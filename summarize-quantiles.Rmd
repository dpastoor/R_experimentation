Trying to figure out an automated way of labeling quantile column names when creating them

eg want to pass in 5 and get q_5 as the column name

```{r}
library(dplyr)
library(lazyeval)
prob <- 0.1
col_name <- "conc"

dots = list(interp(~ quantile(var, prob), var = as.name(col_name)))
Theoph %>% summarize_(.dots=setNames(dots, paste0("q_", prob*10))
Theoph %>% summarize(q_5 = quantile(conc, 0.1))
```
